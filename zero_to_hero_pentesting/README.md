## Attempting to learn pentesting  
I'm going to be following the [Zero To Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeiwBa7d7F_vN1GUwz_2TmVQj) pentesting tutorial  

## Basic structure  
I'll be putting notes in `lesson_notes`  
Any useful scripts I learn will be in `scripts_learned`  
If anything is running python it will be using a virtualenv in `venv`

## Python things  
Hosting an http server
`python3 -m http.server 80`  
This will host on your local ip at port 80 (can also be done in python 2 but slightly different)

Hosting an ftp server
`python3 -m pyftpdlib -p 21 -w`  
This will launch an ftp server if you go to ftp://localhost
