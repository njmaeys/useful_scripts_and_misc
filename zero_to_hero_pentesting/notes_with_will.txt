as im noticing it still really comes down to google fu and network understanding

nmap scap against known ips/target ip
    nmap -T4 -A then ip yada yada
    we are looking for any likely useful ports

    we found useful ports for smb (server message block)
        network shares are hosted in windows

        useful ports: 139, 445

enumerate the ports using a useful nmap script
    script = smb-enum-shares.nse

backups are useful because they often have useful information
    we will try to connect with smbclient and this is used for smb connections
    
    when using smbclient be sure to provide the path to location from nmap
        //MOUNT/<path>

    we mounted the remote machine to our local machine so we could actually parse through it

    we located backups for the windows machine
        copied the vhd to our local machine because we have a connection that allows ftp
        
        used this cool thing vv to mount the vhd to local machine
            https://medium.com/@klockw3rk/mounting-vhd-file-on-kali-linux-through-remote-share-f2f9542c1f25

        after mounting the backups we will be able to go to the local location to view the contents

    windowd machine credentials
        system32/config SAM and SYSTEM
        samdump2 SYSTEM SAM > out.txt -- grabs the hashes from the SAM files
        
        we will use johntheripper

Null Session
    no password -- whatever the hell you put works
    often times first password attempt is ""

Useful Tidbits
    <something>-PC often denotes a user name
    just look for hidden files
