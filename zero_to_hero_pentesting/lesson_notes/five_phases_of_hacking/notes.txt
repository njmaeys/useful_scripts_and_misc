THE FIVE PHASES

Exploiting is nothing if you cant find what you need

1) Recon - Passive and Active
    - Information gathering
    - Passive does not involve client or entity
        - ie; google searches, linkedin, social media   
    - Active (scanning)

PASSIVE RECON
Location
    Building layout - images
    What things are left open ie; doors left open

Social
    Things like job title
    Employees and their names (employee topology)
        Phone numbers, emails, manager info
        Pictures with badges/desk
    More info makes it easier to sound believable

Passive Web/Host
    Target Validation
        Tools: WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon
        confirm that the info you have belongs to who you think it does

    Finding Subdomains
        Tools: Google, dig, nmap, sublist3r, ...
        More info about the site might find "dev.x.com"

    Fingerprinting (Active?)
        Tools: Nmap, Wapalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat 
        Trying to see what tools/backend the site/host is using

    Data Breaches
        Tools: HaveIBeenPwned, ...
        Can we find any creds already found for the domain
        

2) Scanning and Enumeration (all enumeration)

3) Gaining access

4) Maintain access

5) Covering tracks
