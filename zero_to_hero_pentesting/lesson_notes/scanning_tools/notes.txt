TCP / UDP

Port scanning typically on TCP (but can scan UDP as well)

TCP
    Connection oriented and has handshake
    HTTP / FTP / Telnet - high reliability

UDP
    Connectionless with no handshake
    Require fast connect
    DNS / DHCP / SNMP

TCP Scanning
    THREE WAY HANDSHAKE
        SYN - SYN ACK - ACK

        Wireshark - intercept network trafic

        Request sent out (SYN) - Client responds (SYN, ACK) - Acknowledge connection established (ACK)

    NMAP - stealthy (network mapper)
        SYN - SYN ACK - RST (Reset)
        it doesn't make connection just checks and reports on the port

        -sS --> stealth scan
        -sU --> scan UDP
        -oN --> output to file

        -sn --> ping sweep

        it will only scan the top 1K if you dont specify a port range
        nmap -T4 -A -p- 192.168.1.1
            -A specifies everything and will dump all
            -p- sets it to all ports

        staging can improve our scans
            quick then more tactical
            do a quick scan --> nmap -T4 -p- <ip>
                then use the report to then do a in depth scan on returned port

            we could script this out --> script all th things

UDP Scanning
    nmap -sU -T4 192.168.1.1
    
    UDP scanning is SLOW and unreliable

    This is still important just not often going to find things


Nesus

    Download and then install
        dpkg -i <package>

    basic network scan does a good job --> dont need to really dive into the advanced scan

    loud scanning is ok as a pen tester
        help the teams see what they are missing

Metasploit

    msfconsole --> to launch
    basically does lots of shit

    rhost = 1 address
    rhosts = multiple/range of addresses

webscanners

    nikto --> built into kali

        does some scanning and may make recommendations

    burpsuite

        best tool for webapp pen testing
        need some help getting burp to work properly

        be sure to only scan what is in scope of the target
