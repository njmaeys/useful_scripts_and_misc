Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)

Describe process of communication, define steps/processes (conceptual model).

Layering and Encapsulation
  - wrap data from other layers to carry forward
  - often wrapped with headers and footers to ensure accurate communication
  - each layer has it's own specific function
  - each layer communicates with the layer above and below it

  - Mike wants to talk with Sharon
  - Mike application to send message
  - email engine (ie; outlook)
  - email sent to APPLICATION LAYER
    - knows that sharons system needs to do something with it
    - mikes side puts on a header to define it as an email
    - this allows sharons side to know that it goes to email
  - sent to PRESENTATION LAYER
    - formatting, compression, ...
    - another headder added so it knows what to do
  - sent to SESSION LAYER
    - no real session in an email
    - but ie; online banking would have session identifiers
    - ensure someone logs in and has identifiers to know who has what
    - gets a session identifier
  - TRANSPORT LAYER
    - TCP/UDP is responsible for sending of traffic and error handling
    - a transport header is put here
  - NETWORK LAYER
    - logical adressing ip addressing
  - DATALINK LAYER
    - passes to next adjacent point
    - data link header sends to next available access point
    - laptop to router ie;
    - links two connected devices
  - PHYSICAL LAYER
    - then sends it back to DATALINK LAYER
    - removes the header
    - repeat until gets to Sharons machine
    - then it is sent up the chain removing headers along the way

###################################
TCP/IP Model

This is usally what we use

Each layer supports multiple protocols
Works on almost any device

Application
  - Ensure data is in correct format
  - Session management
Transport
  - Host to host layer
  - Manage communications internal
Internet
  - Traffic across network segments
Network Access
  - Sums DataLink and Pysical

###################################
Physical layer

Some physical medium providing connection between devices
  - cable, fiber, optical, satellite, ...
  - transmit messages somehow
  - light pulse, electric pulse, ...
  - analog vs digital

Patch panels and wiring closets

Data Link Layer
  - pysical media
  - media access control (mac) adress
  - network interface card (nic)
  - logical link control (llc)
  - interface between logical and physical
    - make sure things going out are in correct format
    - converts things back into correct format

###################################
Network
  - IP
  - V4 and V6 (better security and more addresses)
  - subnetting allow isolation and control of network
  - ICMP
  - IGMP
  - IP Management
  - internal assignment of IP addresses
  - 10.x.x.x internal addressing is common
    - 16mil addresses we can send
  - 172.31.x.x
    - common used
  - 192.168.x.x
    - common used
  - Usually internal and non routing

Transport
  - End-to-end transport between hosts
  - TCP connection oriented
  - uses packets and ensures stuff is sent
  - UDP connectionless protocol
  - just sends info and runs doesn't hang around
  - common ports
  - 20/21 ftp
  - 22 ssh
  - 25 smtp (email)
  - 53 dns
  - 80 http
  - 110 POPv3 (post office protocol)
  - 443 tls (http over tls connection)

###################################
Session
  - maintains logical connection between two devices
  - ie; my machine with a DB
  - enable services between hosts
  - remote user authentication
  - RADIUS
  - gateway device verifies with that radius
    - password encryption and only used udp
  - TACACS
    - centralized authentication for users
    - uses tcp instead of udp
    - encrypts the entire communication

Presentation
  - ensures things are formatted properly

Application
  - what we actually interact with
  - not actually the application itself
  - facilitates communication between peer applications
  - many protocols used here 
  - ftp, dns, http, ...
  - synchronous messaging
  - im messaging (slack, discord, ...)
  - asynchronous messaging
  - email (smtp)

###################################
Protocol selection

understood format for communcation with its own way of communicating

we have to recognize weaknesses in each protocol and how to combat

RFCs
  - request for comments

ARP (adress resolution protocol)
  - manages mac to ip address
  - connect physical to logical
  - can be "poisoned" and sent to wrong device

ICMP (internet control messaging protocol)
  - ensure connectivity between devices

IGMP (internet group management protocol)
  - send transmition to multiple locations

IP (internet protocol)
  - IPv4 32 bit logical addressing
    - four octets
  - built for communication 
    - easy for spoofing
  - tons of headders for the communication
    - ttl defines allowed number of hops before it "dies"
      - packet is dropped so it no longer keeps seeking dest
  - source/dest ip addresses

  - IPv6 128 bit addressing
    - IPSec designed with security in mind
      - ensures origin has not been spoofed
    - header can vary in length

Routing Protocols
  - how and where to send traffic

TCP
  - cnnection oriented
  - fully duplex (can send and recieve)
  - windowing, ensuring only certain amt of traffic sent/recieve before movign on
    - doesn't overwhelm
  - headers 
    - source and dest port
    - sequence and acknowledgement
      - host to host compare and validate sent info was recieved

UDP
  - connectionless, blurts out info and moves on
  - sends info but doesn't check if it was understood
  - no replay protection

HTTP/HTTPS

###################################
Network Encryption

TLS
  - estblish secure connection
  - 2 parts to this
    - TLS Handshake protocol
    - TLS Record protocol
  - doesn't care what the application protocol is
  - how it works
    - client --> bank wants to connect over http
    - bank --> sends certificate to client
      - this provides public key of bank so client knows the the pub key is pub key of bank
      - the key was provided by a CA (trusted)
    - client checks signature of CA and expiry, checks that url in cert matches
      - all checks out? then it hasn't been altered or expired
    - client then chooses a key, initializaion vector (IV) and HMAC value

###################################
IPSec
  - Sets network layer, end to end encryption
  - Internet Key Exchange
    - Use certificates
  - Authentication Header (AH)
    - Proof of who it comes from
    - Validates that the ip it came from is true
  - VPN
    - Extend private network through public network
    - Virtual point to point connection

OSI Model

Open Systems Interconnect

Layers of OSI

Physical
  - device connection
  - cables (which can vary in type, ie; twisted pair, coax, fiber, ...)
  - all of the protocols that ensure the cables are correct and understood
Data Link
  - protocols to move traffic across the line
    - ie; ethernet protocol (mainly this one)
  - move traffic from one device to another (hops)
Network
  - IP Addressing allow messages to go across longer distances (unique address for all devices)
  - IP Routing allo sending of data from IP to IP (end to end communication)
Transpot
  - Need a session between the client and the server
  - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Session and Presentation (rarely used and not as important in modern world)
  - Presentation ASCII (hexidecimal value of all characters)
    - Translation between hexideciamal encoding types
  - Session 
Application
  - ie; HTTP(s) to transfer the protocol from server into browser

###################################
Protocols and Port Numbers

Application Layer (7)
Transferring Data
  - client server model
  - all of these have Transport Layer (4) protocol 
    - http 80 and https 443
HTTP(s)
  - sending data in specific format so web browser can transfer and translate
  - client software is a browser here
  - server is running server software for websites ie; Apache, Nginx, ...
FTP and those flavors
  - sending files around and there is client/server software to help with this
  - FTP 20, 21 - sFTP 22 - TFTP 69 - SMB 445
Email (many diff protocols)
  - POP3 - IMAP - SMTP
    - SMTP, client to server and routed from server to other client
Authentication
  - LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
    - Active Directory (server side) Windows 10 (client side)
  - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - Automatically tell the info needed to connect to a network
DNS (Domain Name System)
  - Allows use of simple names to communicate with the IP address
  - DNS Server 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS Server)
    - message sent to DNS server on client ie; /etc/resolv.conf
    - 8.8.8.8 returns the IP address of the DNS name requested
  - nslookup gives us the IP of a resolved DNS entry
    - nslookup google.com
Network Time Protocol (NTP)
  - Auto configure all times on clients with times on server
  - Usually publically hosted and in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
    - North to South line passes through Greenwich England (Prime Merridian)
      - 00:00 is midnight at this location
Network Management Protocol
  - Tlenet (23) and SSH (22)

###################################
Transport Layer (4)
TCP and UDP
TCP
  - Need to establish session between client and server
  - Phone Convo
    - need to pick up phone, wait for dial tone, dial phone number, rings, waits for ansewr "hello", session established
  - 3-way handshake
    - SYN message from client to web server
    - SYN-ACK Server then sends a reply SYN-ACK
    - ACK Client sends an ACK
    - Each of these changes the state
    - Once session is established we can send other things like http
    - If anything goes wrong the client/server can send an additional request for more info
  - 4-way disconnect
    - FIN from server
    - FIN-ACK got the finish from client
    - FIN from client
    - FIN-ACK from server
    - RST forces the TCP session to hang up and prevents further communication
UDP
  - User Datagram Protocol
  - Wraps up data and sends request for data
  - Server sends data
  - This is all sent without acknowledgement of sent request or sent response
    - Data can be lost
  - Very efficient for small data packets

###################################
Intro to Bnary and Hexideciamal
Network Layer
Binary 101
  - 1 or 0 on or off
  - placeholders
    - 00000000 = 0
    - 00000001 = 1
    - 00000010 = 2
    - 00000011 = 3
    - ... so on
Binary to Decimal
  - 128s 64s 32s 16s 8s 4s 2s 1s
  - 11000000 = 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 192
Hexadecimal
  - every hexideciamal value converts to 4 binary bits
  - 0 to 16
    - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10

###################################
Intro to IP Addressing
Network Layer (3)
0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255
  - Network portion 0.0.0.x
    - zipcode
  - Host portion x.x.x.0
    - street address
IP address construction
  - converted to decimal from binary
  - 32 bit value broken into 4 octet (8bits long)
    - 203.0.113.10
    - 11001011 00000000 01110001 00001010
IP Address types
  - Network address 
    - identifier for a group of devices, IP Address in a system
    - range of IP addresses 
    - if all 0 in host portion then it is network
  - Broadcast address
    - identifier for all devices on network
    - if all 1 in the host portion then it is broadcast
  - Host address
    - identifies unique device on a network
    - anything except all 0 or all 1 in host portion
CIDR Notation
  - 203.0.113.10
  - 255.255.255.0
    - /24 (number of bits in the network portion)
    - there are 24 1s in the mask
    - 203.0.113.10/24

###################################
Subnetting Networks
Breaking networks into smaller networks
10.0.0.0/8 (private IP range)
10.0.0.0 -> 10.2555.255.255
10.0.10.0
  - host address on 10.0.0.0/8 network
  - could move subnetmask to /24 position
    - 10.0.10.0/24 can now be a network address
    - 10.0.10.0 -> 10.0.10.255
      - makes a more manageable rage of IP address in this subnet

###################################

IP Routing
Network Layer (3)
End to end Communication (client to server round trip)
Basic Network
  - PC -> switch -> router -> internet
  - want devices to send traffic locally and over internet
IP Packet (header plus data)
  - specify source/dest IP
  - TTL (128, can hit 128 routers before it is tossed away)
    - prevents loops at layer 3
  - Headers for the info being sent and other
  - ARP (address resolution protocol)
    - only works for local area network
    - allows us to get MAC address (layer 2) of destination
      - message goes to ALL other devices in network with dest IP 
      - the machine that has that IP responds and sends back the MAC address
Default Gateway
  - Gateway == Router
  - place where PC sends traffic when it doesn't know how to reach destination
    - destination is in diff subnet than our machine
  - Routers throw away ARP messages (doesn't forward layer 2 request)
  - ARP the default gateway
  - Requests need to hop through routers
    - The routers consult their IP tables to send data along
Can use tracert to view the route traffic takes
  - see the IP addresses hit during the trip

###################################
Network Services
Network Topologies
  - Local Area Network (LAN)
    - All devices connected to one router including the router
    - Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
      - still local area but introduction of wireless router
    - May have many in a given building
    - To connect multiple buildings you need a Wide Area Network (WAN)
Network Address Translation
  - Any org/home/user can use internal network using specific address ranges
    - All of these are private addresses
    - 10.0.0.0/8 - 172.16.0.0/12 - 192.168.0.0/16
    - internet throws away these IP addresses and communication cannot use these
Port Forwarding
  - ie; info coming in from port 80 sends to port 8080 on internal device
Access Control List
  - On router you can deny specific destination IP addresses
    - Tosses out the packets
Traffic Shaping
  - Give priority to some traffic
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  - Provide IP addresses to internal devices in a network
  - Often a home router has this built in
  - Larger enterprises often has a server doing that configuration
  - DHCP Lease typtically only good for 7 days
    - Computer asks for the IP address 3.5 days in requesting for the IP address again
DNS Hierarchy Uniform Resource Locater (URL)
  - Top Level Domain (TLD)
    - .com .edu .org .net ...
  - Second Level Domain 
    - The domain name ie; pluralsight in pluralsight.com
  - Third level Domain
    - Hostname ie; www
    - doesn't have to be www immediately, this is just to define hierarchy 
Reverse DNS Lookup
  - What is the domain for a given IP address
